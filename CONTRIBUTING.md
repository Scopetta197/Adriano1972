## Development Workflow

After cloning REACT COOL STARTER, run `yarn` to fetch its dependencies. Then, you can run [several commands](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter#script-commands).

## Style Guide

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org), [StyleLint](https://stylelint.io) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code style and formatting. Run `yarn lint` after making any changes to the code. Then, our linter will catch most issues that may exist in your code.

However, there are still some styles that the linter cannot pick up. If you are unsure about something, looking at [Airbnb’s Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) will guide you in the right direction.
